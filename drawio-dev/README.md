## About

draw.io is a configurable diagramming and whiteboarding application, jointly owned and developed by draw.io Ltd (previously named JGraph) and draw.io AG. We also run a production deployment at https://app.diagrams.net.

## Contributions

We do not accept pull requests. The project is developed entirely by the core team. The entire draw.io editor is human written by the core, full-time development team, no AI generation. 

## Scope

draw.io is a diagramming and whiteboarding application. It is not an SVG editor. SVG export is intended for embedding in web pages, not for editing in other tools.

Note that draw.io does not support real-time collaborative editing in this version, currently.

For issues or questions about the editor in any draw.io product, the issue tracker and discussions here are a good starting point.
